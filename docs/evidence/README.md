# Historical evidence

This directory preserves sanitized, dated evidence for decisions that led to
the current V1 design. It is deliberately separate from the present-tense
product contract:

- [Design](../design.md) defines product and architecture.
- [Roadmap](../roadmap.md) defines delivery status and acceptance gates.
- The evidence below records the exact candidate, environment, procedure, and
  limitations stated in each file. Its historical versions, test counts, and
  UI details are not current behavior by themselves.

## D3-D15 SSH and remote evidence is historical

D3 through D15 were completed against earlier product surfaces. Any SSH,
remote-host, cross-host, host-registration, remote-attachment, or combined
catalog behavior described by those checkpoints is historical evidence for the
candidate that was tested. D16 retires WSNav-managed SSH and cross-host
operation from the current contract: the supported multi-host composition is
ordinary operator SSH followed by a host-local `wsnav` instance, with separate
terminal windows per host. The historical files are intentionally not rewritten
to make their old procedures appear current.

## Authority archives

- [Roadmap through D18 design](../roadmap-through-d18-design.md) preserves
  the complete pre-slimming delivery narrative and its original status detail.
  The active roadmap is [`../roadmap.md`](../roadmap.md).

## Design spikes

The [spikes](spikes/) establish the narrow tmux, remote attachment, native
Codex presentation, observer, naming, and settled-fork boundaries. They are
falsification studies, not product documentation. [Spike
0014](spikes/0014-terminal-fidelity-a-b.md) adds the deterministic A/B
instrument for the deferred terminal-fidelity cursor amplification; [Spike
0018](spikes/0018-navigator-input-latency.md) separates local synthetic input
delivery from presentation echo under static and 10 FPS Navigator panes; [Spike
0015](spikes/0015-opencode-provider-feasibility.md) records the
opencode provider fork-exactness, fork-lineage, and shared-database
concurrency probes; [Spike
0016](spikes/0016-opencode-runtime-contract.md) records the native TUI
Runtime, observer, and exact HTTP Fork boundary; and [Spike
0017](spikes/0017-opencode-fresh-session.md) records blank-session binding,
endpoint ownership, and per-Runtime observer sidecar evidence.
[Spike 0019](spikes/0019-brokered-onboarding-shell.md) records the bounded
brokered provisional-shell topology study and its implementation limits.
[Spike 0020](spikes/0020-opencode-1.18.23-revalidation.md) records the
OpenCode `1.18.23` revalidation of the historical fresh-session contract.
[Spike 0021](spikes/0021-d17-two-phase-handshake.md) validates the narrow D17
prepare-capability-helper-exec topology across synthetic Bash/Zsh and
Codex/OpenCode routes while preserving the remaining D17.0 acceptance gates.
[Spike 0022](spikes/0022-d17-account-shell-wrapper.md) validates the controlled
non-login Bash/Zsh account-wrapper candidate and records the mandatory Bash
login preflight boundary.
[Spike 0023](spikes/0023-d17-provisional-lock.md) validates the isolated
schema-14 stable `provisional.lock` installation and refusal lifecycle while
leaving the cross-actor onboarding races as D17.0 work.
[Spike 0024](spikes/0024-d17-provider-grammar.md) pins the conservative fresh
native-TUI grammar for Codex `0.150.0` and OpenCode `1.18.23`, without claiming
provider-effect or recovery integration.
[Spike 0025](spikes/0025-d17-provisional-ownership.md) validates the serialized
marker-to-owned-runtime winner model and its action fence, without claiming the
concurrent production implementation.
[Spike 0026](spikes/0026-d17-provider-effect-journal.md) validates the
synthetic provider-effect journal ordering for Codex no-effect and OpenCode
known/ambiguous blank-session creation, without launching either provider.
[Spike 0027](spikes/0027-d18-root-move-falsification.md) records why an
unprivileged online process cannot prove the race-free zero-holder boundary
required by the rejected coherent-backup/online-rollback design. The current
D18 destructive reset does not claim that boundary; no release tool or
ordinary-state move was attempted during the spike.
[Spike 0028](spikes/0028-d19-navigation-readiness.md) records the D19
disposable private-tmux readiness evidence and the three baseline
falsifications that require exact Runtime topology, read-only attachment
validation, and one shared activity-based visual order before implementation.
The later [D19 acceptance record](acceptance/d19-tmux-navigation.md) binds the
implemented correction of those falsifications to its local/disposable gate
and installed artifact without claiming live-provider or remote-CI evidence.

## Provider studies

The [studies](studies/) directory records focused provider-contract research
used to make the design conservative and reproducible. [Study
0004](studies/0004-herdr-v0.8-comparison.md) is the competitive-positioning
exception: it compares the released V1 against Herdr 0.8.0 as documentation
research and changes no product boundary.
